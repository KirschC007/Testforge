## Ambiguity Gate

### B-008 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec states 'full access' for owner but doesn't explicitly define what 'full access' entails beyond deleting workspaces and managing billing. It's unclear if 'full access' implies all permissions of other roles or additional, unlisted permissions.
**Question:** What specific actions are included in 'full access' for the 'owner' role? Does it encompass all permissions of admin, member, and viewer roles?

### B-012 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The mechanism for 'explicitly shared' projects with guests is not defined. It's unclear how a project is shared, who can share it, and if there are different levels of guest access (e.g., read-only, comment-only).
**Question:** How are projects explicitly shared with 'guest' users? What are the permissions granted to a guest on a shared project?

### B-019 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec states `workspaceId` must match JWT `workspaceId` for POST /api/projects, but it's not explicitly stated for other endpoints that take `workspaceId` (e.g., GET /api/projects, GET /api/tasks, POST /api/comments, POST /api/time-entries). While 'Cross-workspace access returns 403' is mentioned generally, the specific check for the input `workspaceId` matching JWT `workspaceId` is only explicitly called out here.
**Question:** Does the `workspaceId` input parameter for all endpoints (e.g., GET /api/projects, GET /api/tasks, POST /api/comments, POST /api/time-entries) also need to match the user's JWT `workspaceId`? Or is the general 'Cross-workspace access returns 403' sufficient for those?

### B-022 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The `search` input parameter for GET /api/projects is a string, but its behavior is not defined (e.g., what fields it searches, if it's case-sensitive, if it supports partial matches or wildcards).
**Question:** How does the `search` parameter for GET /api/projects function? What fields does it search, and what kind of matching (e.g., exact, partial, case-insensitive) does it perform?

### B-025 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The behavior 'Cross-workspace access returns 403' for GET /api/projects is broad. It's unclear if this applies when the `workspaceId` query parameter is explicitly provided and doesn't match the JWT, or if it implies an implicit workspace context from the JWT that is always enforced.
**Question:** When does 'Cross-workspace access returns 403' apply to GET /api/projects? Is it when the `workspaceId` query parameter is provided and doesn't match the user's JWT, or is it an implicit check based on the JWT's `workspaceId` regardless of query parameters?

### B-044 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The `search` input parameter for GET /api/tasks is a string, but its behavior is not defined (e.g., what fields it searches, if it's case-sensitive, if it supports partial matches or wildcards).
**Question:** How does the `search` parameter for GET /api/tasks function? What fields does it search, and what kind of matching (e.g., exact, partial, case-insensitive) does it perform?

### B-048 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The definition of 'own tasks' and 'tasks assigned to them' for a member is clear, but the behavior for a member editing 'someone else's unassigned task' returning 403 NOT_YOUR_TASK implies a specific error code for this scenario. It's not explicitly stated what happens if a member tries to edit 'someone else's assigned task' (i.e., assigned to another member) or 'someone else's own task'.
**Question:** What is the expected behavior (and error code) if a member attempts to edit a task that is assigned to another member, or a task created by another member but not assigned to anyone?

### B-053 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The 'Status machine rules apply' for PATCH /api/tasks/:id/status, but the specific HTTP status code or error message for an invalid transition is not defined. For example, if a user tries to move 'todo' to 'done'.
**Question:** What is the specific HTTP status code and error message returned when an invalid task status transition is attempted?

### B-061 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The 'Status machine rules apply to each task individually' for bulk status updates, but it's not specified what happens if some tasks in the bulk request have valid transitions and others have invalid ones. The 'Atomic' rule says 'if any task fails validation, none are updated', which seems to contradict individual rule application if a valid task's update is rolled back due to another's invalidity.
**Question:** If a bulk status update contains tasks with both valid and invalid status transitions, does the 'Atomic' rule (none are updated if any fail validation) apply to *any* validation failure (including state machine rules), or only to input validation for the `taskIds` or `status` parameters?

### B-067 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The behavior for guest commenting on shared projects is mentioned, but the definition of 'shared projects' for guests is not fully detailed. It's unclear if guest comments are limited to specific projects, or if they have full commenting abilities on any project they can view.
**Question:** What are the specific conditions for a guest user to be able to comment on a project? Are there any limitations on their commenting abilities (e.g., only on certain tasks, or only if they have specific permissions on the shared project)?

### B-072 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec mentions 'time tracking' as a feature gate, but it doesn't explicitly state what happens if a user on a plan without time tracking attempts to use the /api/time-entries endpoint. B-096 partially addresses this for 'Free' plan users, but not for other plans.
**Question:** What is the specific error message and HTTP status code if a user on a 'Pro' plan (which has time tracking) tries to log time but their workspace somehow doesn't have the 'time tracking' feature enabled (if that's possible)? Or if a 'Business' plan user tries to log time and fails due to a feature gate?

### B-103 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The '5s grace period' for catching orphaned tasks is mentioned, but the mechanism for this grace period and how orphans are detected and cleaned up is not detailed. It's also unclear if 'orphaned tasks' refers to tasks that were in the process of being created but whose parent project was deleted, or any task that loses its project reference.
**Question:** What is the exact mechanism for the '5s grace period' and how are orphaned tasks detected and cleaned up? What defines an 'orphaned task' in this context?
