## Ambiguity Gate

### B-016 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec states 'Customer with customerId must exist and belong to same bankId' but does not specify the error code or HTTP status if this condition is not met for account creation.
**Question:** What HTTP status code and error message should be returned if the customer does not exist or belongs to a different bank during account creation?

### B-056 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec states 'Frozen accounts cannot send transactions' but does not specify the exact error code or HTTP status for this rejection.
**Question:** What HTTP status code and error message should be returned when an attempt is made to send a transaction from a frozen account?

### B-070 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec mentions 'DELETE /api/customers/:id/gdpr' but does not define its authorization requirements.
**Question:** What authorization role(s) are required to call DELETE /api/customers/:id/gdpr? Is it admin only, or can a customer request anonymization of their own data?

### B-073 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec mentions 'GET /api/customers/:id/export' but does not define its authorization requirements.
**Question:** What authorization role(s) are required to call GET /api/customers/:id/export? Is it admin only, or can a customer request export of their own data?
