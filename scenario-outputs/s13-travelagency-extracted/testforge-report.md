## Ambiguity Gate

### B-006 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec does not explicitly state the authentication requirements for bookings.create.
**Question:** Which roles are authorized to call `bookings.create`? The 'Roles' section states 'agent — Can create/view bookings', but the API endpoint does not list auth requirements.

### B-023 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec states 'anonymize/delete' but then specifies 'replaced with [DELETED]'. This implies anonymization rather than full deletion.
**Question:** Does 'deleteCustomerData' mean full deletion of records or just anonymization of PII fields? If records are kept, what other data remains linked to the anonymized customer?

### B-027 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The success criteria for UF-03 states 'Export contains all PII fields (name, email, phone)' but the spec for `gdpr.exportCustomerData` returns `{ customer: Customer, bookings: Booking[], exportedAt: string }` which implies the full Customer object.
**Question:** Does the `gdpr.exportCustomerData` endpoint return the full Customer object including `passportNumber` or only the explicitly listed PII fields (name, email, phone)?
