## Ambiguity Gate

### B-005 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec says 'customer — Can view own bookings only' but doesn't specify how 'own' is determined (e.g., by customerId on the booking matching the logged-in customer's ID, or if customer has a direct relation to the booking).
**Question:** How is 'own bookings' determined for a customer? Is it based on `customerId` field in the booking matching the authenticated customer's ID?

### B-008 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec states 'Only agency_admin can cancel a confirmed booking' but doesn't explicitly state what happens if an agent or customer tries to cancel a confirmed booking, or if an admin tries to cancel a booking in another state (e.g., pending).
**Question:** What is the expected behavior (e.g., HTTP status code) if a non-admin tries to cancel a confirmed booking, or if an admin tries to cancel a booking in a state other than 'confirmed'?

### B-015 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec says 'replaced with [DELETED]' but doesn't specify if this replacement happens in-place in the database, or if the original data is moved to an archive, or if it's actually deleted and then a placeholder is shown.
**Question:** Does 'anonymized (replaced with [DELETED])' mean the data is physically overwritten in the database, or is it soft-deleted/archived with a placeholder in the UI?

### B-016 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec mentions 'Export must include all bookings for the customer' but doesn't specify the format of the export (e.g., JSON, CSV, PDF) or the exact fields of the booking to be included.
**Question:** What is the format of the exported customer data (e.g., JSON, CSV)? Which specific fields of the bookings should be included in the export?

### B-017 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec mentions 'Customer receives booking reference' but doesn't specify how or when this reference is received (e.g., email, SMS, in-app notification).
**Question:** How does the customer receive the booking reference (e.g., email, SMS, in-app)? When is it sent?
