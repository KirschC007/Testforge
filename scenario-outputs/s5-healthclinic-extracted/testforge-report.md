## Ambiguity Gate

### B-007 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The term 'own patients' is not clearly defined for a doctor. Does it mean patients they have treated, or patients assigned to them?
**Question:** How is 'own patients' determined for a doctor? Is it based on past appointments, assigned patient lists, or some other criteria?

### B-008 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The phrase 'read all within clinic' for a doctor conflicts with 'full access to own patients' if 'all within clinic' includes patients not considered 'own'.
**Question:** Does 'read all within clinic' imply read access to *all* patients in the clinic, regardless of whether they are 'own patients'?

### B-022 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The spec says 'nurse sees demographics only if role=nurse' for GET /api/patients, but for GET /api/patients/:id, it says 'nurse sees demographics + vitals'. This is a contradiction or an unclear distinction.
**Question:** What is the exact data visibility for a nurse when listing patients vs. viewing a single patient? Is it demographics only for lists and demographics + vitals for details, or is there a single rule?

### B-036 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The phrase 'reason required' for cancellation is not specified as an input field or error code.
**Question:** How is the cancellation reason provided (e.g., a new field in PATCH /api/appointments/:id/status)? What is the error code if it's missing?

### B-048 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** The calculation of 'billingAmount' is mentioned but no details are provided on how it's calculated.
**Question:** What is the logic for calculating `billingAmount` when an appointment is completed?

### B-052 — ⚠ Reduces Confidence
**Problem:** It states 'Medical records retained (anonymized patient reference) for 10 years'. It's unclear what 'anonymized patient reference' means in practice after the patient's PII is nulled by the GDPR delete.
**Question:** What specific data points constitute an 'anonymized patient reference' that allows medical records to be retained for 10 years, and how does it relate to the anonymization process in DELETE /api/patients/:id/gdpr?
